# ApeManuscript
Here we upload files, codes and figures for Oskolkov et al. comparative transcriptomics analysis between humans and great apes
* human_specific_DE_genes.txt is a list of 997 differentially expressed genes between human and chimp that also demonstrate a consitent pattern across all the other great apes, i.e. consistently down- or up-regulated in the apes compared to humans
* featureCounts_count_OnlyExpressedGenes_TMM_Normalized_WithinEachSpecies_DGE_DESeq2.txt is a DGE human vs. chimp output from DESeq2 
* featureCounts_count_OnlyExpressedGenes_TMM_Normalized_WithinEachSpecies_DGE_Wilcox.txt is a DGE human vs. chimp output from Mann-Whitney U test
* featureCounts_OnlyExpressedExons_TMM_Normalized_DEU_DEXSeq.zip is a DEU human vs. chimp output from DEXseq
* featureCounts_OnlyExpressedExons_TMM_Normalized_DEU_Wilcox.zip is a DEU human vs. chimp output from Mann-Whitney U test
